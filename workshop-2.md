# Workshop 2
In this workshop you have a chance to practice marking up a full web page with metadata, pictures, external links, and a few intermediate structural elements beyond the paragraph.

You also have a chance to practice making HTML more meaningful with semantic markup, as well as debugging HTML using a helpful online tool.

## Mark up an article with images and links

1. I have provided the text and images for an article about sea serpents in the 16th century. Download it by visiting the [olaus-magnus.zip on GitHub](workshop-2-files/olaus-magnus.zip).

### Checklist
- How did you handle the block quotes beginning “They who in Works of Navigation...” and “. . . the wondrous tales told by Pontoppidan”?

## Debug a buggy document with an HTML validator
## Fix a case of divitis by bringing meaning to a document
