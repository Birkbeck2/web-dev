  - title: What is this website?
    details: "This website has learning materials related to the Birkbeck
    MA module on web development. It works alongside the Moodle page for
    the module. If in doubt, always check Moodle first, and use it as your
    source of truth. Moodle will send you here sometimes to follow lecture
    content, complete workshops, and see code in action."
  - title: How was it created?
    details: "This site is made with GitHub and VitePress, a static site
    generator made by the community behind Vue.js. The content was written
    in text files in Markdown format, saved to a GitHub repository.
    VitePress runs JavaScript to convert the markdown into HTML, add
    styling, create an index for the search feature, and provide the URL
    routing."
