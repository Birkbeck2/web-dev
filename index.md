  - title: What is this website?
    details: "This website has learning materials related to two modules
    in the Birkbeck Digital Media Design programme: ARMC243S7 Web
    Development and User Experience, and ARMC244S7 Visual Design and Web
    Project. It works alongside the Moodle pages for the modules. If in
    doubt, always check Moodle first, and use it as your source of truth.
    Moodle will send you here sometimes to follow lecture content,
    complete workshops, and see code samples."
  - title: How was it made?
    details: "This site is made with GitHub and VitePress, a static site
    generator made by the community behind Vue.js. The content was written
    in text files in Markdown format, saved to a GitHub repository.
    VitePress runs JavaScript to convert the markdown into HTML, add
    styling, create an index for the search feature, and provide the URL
    routing."
