        <h1>Hierarchy of road users</h1>
        <p>The ‘hierarchy of road users’ is a concept that places those road users most at risk in the event of a collision at the top of the hierarchy. The hierarchy does not remove the need for everyone to behave responsibly. The road users most likely to be injured in the event of a collision are pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists, with children, older adults and disabled people being more at risk. The following H rules clarify this concept.</p>
        <h2>Rule H1</h2>
        <p>It is important that <strong>ALL</strong> road users are aware of <em>The Highway Code</em>, are considerate to other road users and understand their responsibility for the safety of others.</p>
        <p>Everyone suffers when road collisions occur, whether they are physically injured or not. But those in charge of vehicles that can cause the greatest harm in the event of a collision bear the greatest responsibility to take care and reduce the danger they pose to others. This principle applies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, vans/minibuses, cars/taxis and motorcycles.</p>
        <p>Cyclists, horse riders and drivers of horse-drawn vehicles likewise have a responsibility to reduce danger to pedestrians.</p>
        <p>None of this detracts from the responsibility of <strong>ALL</strong> road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders, to have regard for their own and other road users’ safety.</p>
        <p>Always remember that the people you encounter may have impaired sight, hearing or mobility and that this may not be obvious.</p>
