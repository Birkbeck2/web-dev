or use [Apple
Voiceover](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac).
Find a list of commands, and try browse some websites you are familiar
with, and some you are not familiar with, only using the technology.

Try navigating a few websites without using the mouse or touchpad at all,
just the keyboard. Try websites you're familiar with and also ones that
you are less familiar with.

Try testing a website with an automated tool like LightHouse or WAVE:
