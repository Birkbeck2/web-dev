# JavaScript values

We've already learned about some *values* through HTML attributes and CSS
rules.

In JavaScript, we need to learn these values a bit more carefully, because this
is the main material that JavaScript runs on. Whereas HTML and CSS were focused
on media like text and images, JavaScript is built from the ground up out of
values, and the value types matter.

We refer to the types as *data types* because to JavaScript, all content, all
values, are data.

## Strings

Let's pick back up with `console.log('Hello');`. Why is `'Hello'` in quotation
marks?

As a sequence of letters, the word "hello" is declared to JavaScript as
a particular kind of thing, a *string*.

Strings are the first JavaScript data type to know about. A string can be
nearly any sequence of letters, numbers, or unicode items.

These are all valid strings:

```js
'Hello'
"Hello"
'bbk.ac.uk'
"blue"
"How do you say 'hello' in Arabic?"
"Ê±âËØ≠"
"ÿßŸéŸÑŸíÿπŸéÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©"
"200"
"<h2>Check your understanding</h2>"
"d9fs0df9w3s9fsdf-sd9fw-9n23-r2n3f9-9SF-ZX9ZF2092N30FN20F9N"
'‚Äò!P¬£$(&^)"¬£$(&^"¬£!$P(!FP(J!F)(¬£J!'
```

## Rules for strings

### Start and end with matching quote marks

Strings must start and end with matching quotation marks, either single (`'`)
or double (`"`).

### Cannot contain the quote mark used at start and end

JavaScript uses the quotation marks to understand where the value starts and
ends. So, strings cannot contain the quotation mark they start and end with,
unless *escaped*. 

What does this mean? Two things, in practice:

1.  If you need to write quote marks inside a string, you can alternate them
    so that they are different from the start and end marks. For example, use
    double on the outside, and single on the inside, or vice versa:

    ```js
    "How do you say 'hello' in Arabic?"
    'How do you say "hello" in Arabic?'
    ```

2.  You can use the same mark, but put a backslash (`\`) in front of it, so that
    it eludes or *escapes* the algorithm that JavaScript uses to figure out
    which things are strings:

    ```js
    "How do you say \"hello\" in Arabic?"
    'How do you say \'hello\' in Arabic?'
    ```

    What if you have a string that has a backslash in it? Escape it as well by
    putting another one in front of it:

    ```js
    "The files are located at C:\\Users\\Documents"
    ```

    JavaScript will interpret this as a valid string with a value of `The files
    are located at C:\Users\Documents`.

### Check your understanding

1.  Can you make a string like this?

    ```js
    'Hello"
    ```
2.  How many valid strings does this line have? Where do they start and end?
    ```js
    "There are many "ways" you can "interpret" things."
    ```
3.  Is this a valid string?
    ```js
    "I told him I'm \"excited\" üôÑ"
    ```
## Numbers

After strings, numbers are the next most common data type.

Numbers are declared in your code without any quotation marks, with `-` if they are negative, and with `.` as a decimal point for fractional numbers:

```js
3
8519
-62
8.52
.99
```

If you put quotation marks around numbers, JavaScript thinks they are strings:

```js
'8'
"105"
'-2'
```
### Check your understanding

1.  Does JavaScript think this is a number?
    ```js
    "8,325"
    ```
2.  How about this?
    ```js
    -39.2301
    ```
## Boolean values

Often you need a value that operates like a toggle switch, so that it can be
turned on or off, say yes or no, or turn up true or false.

There is a special data type for these values, the *boolean* type.

These values are represented with keywords `true` and `false`:

```js
true
false
```

You don't put quotation marks around these words, or else they would be
interpreted as strings.

### Check your understanding

What data types does JavaScript think these things are?

1. `true`
2. `1`
3. `'False'`
4. `"on"`

## `undefined` and `null` values

In the absence of a working value, JavaScript will substitute the keyword
`undefined`, which is its own data type.

This might happen if a string, boolean or number doesn't get set up the right
way.

All of the following evaluate to `undefined` in the following script:

```js
True
orange
l0
```

You can also refer to and work with an empty value called `null`:

```js
null
```

This just lets you explicitly write that rather than a string, number, or
boolean, you're declaring a blank, meaningless value.

At the moment, it might be unclear why this is useful, but you will see soon.
For now, know it exists.

## Checking value types

Like with `console.log();`, you can query JavaScript for the type of a value.
Put `typeof` before the value, and JavaScript will evaluate its type.

```js
typeof 'blah blah'
```

By combining this with `console.log();`, you can check the type of anything:

This is useful in debugging your code.

Run
[type-script.js](https://github.com/Birkbeck2/web-development/tree/main/public/sandbox/js-typeof/)
with modifications to check the types of several values.

## But why?

At this point you know what data types are, but you may be wondering, why do
they matter? Why is it important for JavaScript to interpret `2` as a number
and `"2"` as a string?

It has to do with how the values are used in the program. Many uses depend on
a particular data type, so the language allows, and often requires, that you
explicitly set data types through the syntax you use.

In the next section, things will become clearer when we look at some of the
basic ways to use values, with *operators*.
