# Command Line Tools

The command line is an essential medium for programmers. While most things
can be done through graphical interfaces, programmers often fall back to
command-line tools for simplicity, efficiency, and interoperability.

They use the command line to configure and maintain development and server
environments, install fameworks and dependencies, perform version control,
write instructions for each other, and write and run code.

By becoming familiar with shell commands, you can ensure that you can
collaborate effectively, follow tutorials and instructions, and take
charge of your digital toolbox.

## Shell language commands

When you open a shell on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you automatically have
access to a small language of commands that are known as *shell commands*.

There are different dialects, including BASH, ZSH, and Powershell,
depending on your operating systems and which shell you have configured,
but many of the most basic commands are similar if not the same.

Shell commands let you perform basic file management functions like
viewing, naming, renaming, moving, and deleting files and folders.

It is worth saving a list of common commands and trying them out until
they start to become muscle memory. One popular sheet is Rehan Saheed’s
“[Bash Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/RehanSaeed/Bash-Cheat-Sheet).” You
can use most of these commands in [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
(Windows) or Terminal (Mac / Linux).

## Application-specific commands

Many common applications like code editors and web browsers are mapped to
shell commands of their own. Examples:

```shell
firefox index.html  	# Open the HTML file in Firefox
code script.js      	# Open the JavaScript file in VS Code
```

These allow you to use the shell as the launchpad for viewing
and editing environments. 

Most programming languages also have their own commands that you can run
programs with. Examples:

```shell 
node script.js		# Run the JavaScript file using Node.js
python manage.py	# Run the Python file with Python
```

## Git commands

Ah, your old friend!

Git was designed first and foremost as a commnand-line utility. Spending
time using Git at the command line will not be time wasted, if you plan to
work anywhere in or near web design or software development.

There are two ways we recommend learning Git at the command line:

1. Follow a high-quality video course such as [“Learning Git and GitHub” by Ray Villalobos](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-git-and-github-14213624)

2. Get a list of commands and practice them. Cheat sheets in multiple
   languages can be downloaded from [GitHub’s training kit](https://training.github.com/).

### GitHub authentication

One snafu you might encounter is the challenge of configuring Git
authentication so that you can smoothly push code to GitHub.

The best way to get past this hurdle is to configure an SSH key. GitHub
has detailed [instructions for different operating
systems](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

It may seem daunting to follow these instructions, but doing so is a good
way of building your command-line skills.
