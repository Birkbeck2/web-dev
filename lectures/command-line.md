# The Command Line

The longer you work in web design and development, you will be asked to
run things on the command line.

In this segment we will attempt to help you feel more like a confident
hacker in a movie, and less like someone who is about to destroy your
computer.

## Why use it?

1. **Low-level control**. User interfaces often do not provide the nitty
   gritty detail you need as a programmer, especially when installing
   things or fixing a problem.

2. **Universality**. With the Unix shell available or installable on all
   nearly all computers, the command line becomes a universal interface
   for performing actions in a dependable way, and communicating with
   other developers about how to do things (installation, configuration,
   etc.). This includes web servers, which do not have graphical user
   interfaces.

3. **Automation**. You can package several commands up into a script and
   save them in files ending with `.sh`, so that they can be run all
   together with a single command.

4. **Continuity**. The Unix shell has been around for decades, while many
   GUIs have come and gone. So if you invest time in a project that uses
   it, the project will have a longer lifespan too, because it won't
   depend on something that might fall out of fashion.

5. **Usability**. OK, the user experience of the command line does leave
   much to be desired, at first. But once you learn it, you will find it
   is highly interactive, fast, endlessly customisable with colors,
   symbols, emoji, colors, and animation.

## Unix shell

When you open a shell on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you automatically have
access to a small language of commands that are known as *shell commands*.

There are different dialects, and the most popular one is **Unix**, which
describes a set of commands that are available on Linux and Mac OSX, and
which can be installed for free on Windows. 

### Windows options

- Git Bash (included with Git for Windows)

- Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Learning the Unix shell

The command line is highly interactive, so the best way to learn is to get
a list of commands and try them out.

One popular cheat sheet is Rehan Saheed’s “[Bash Cheat
Sheet](https://github.com/RehanSaeed/Bash-Cheat-Sheet).”

## Try it out

Try these commands out in a safe [sandbox
environment](https://github.com/Birkbeck2/web-development/tree/main/public/sandbox/command-line).

Starting with the contents of this folder, can you accomplish these tasks
just with shell commands?

1. Move the images to their own folder

2. Make some more copies of the images

3. Create an empty index.html

4. Create an empty styles.css

5. Delete the old code
