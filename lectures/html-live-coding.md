## Template recognition

Go to any website, find something that might have interesting HTML, and inspect it.

* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/)
* [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/)

Questions for inspecting websites:

1. Can you predict what markup something will use before you inspect it?

2. Considering what you know about presentational and semantic HTML,
   what would you change about the markup, if anything?
