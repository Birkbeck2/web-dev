# Workshop: Preparing for your Web Project

## Part 1: Practical

Scenario: You want to make a website that you can share with others.

Task: Create a Birkbeck GitHub repository through GitHub Classroom, and then
publish the website using GitHub Pages.

::: tip
Outside this module, you don’t need to use GitHub Classroom. You can
make repositories on your own GitHub account, publish them
with Pages, and share them with clients, employers, and collaborators.

### Steps

1. Set up the GitHub repository for your web project, if you have not done so
   already. Here’s how: Go to the Assessment tile on Moodle, scroll down to the
   submission section, and click on the link called “GitHub Repository Setup.”

3. Once your repository is created by GitHub Classroom, create a file called
   `index.html` *in the top level of the repository* with some HTML that
   displays “Hello World”, or something else for
   you to check that it worked. (The content is not important, it just needs to
   be an `index.html` page that loads something.)

   Need a refresher on Git and GitHub? Here are some options:

    - [Revisit the concepts](/lectures/git.html)

    - Use the built-in graphical interface in VS Code to manage Git: [VS Code

    - Use the GitHub Desktop App: [Git, GitHub, and Github Desktop for
    Beginners](https://youtu.be/8Dd7KRpKeaE), Coder Coder,

    - If all else fails, edit your repository files in the browser: [Working with
    files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files),
    GitHub Docs

4. Publish the website with GitHub Pages.

## Part 2: Creative

Please choose one of the following options.

### Creative Option A: Experiment with something learned today

Some ideas:

1. Make a timer that counts down from 10 to 0.

2. Create an animation that uses timeouts or intervals.

3. Create something that combines user inputs (events) with fetching data.

4. Fix an earlier program you wrote with your new debugging knowledge.

5. Explore NPM packages, choose one, install it, and make something with it.

### Creative Option B: Work on your web project

Now that you have your assessment repository set up, you can start building
your web project.

::: tip
Push early, and push often! That way you can share your work
using the GitHub Pages link to get feedback and encouragement.
