# Workshop: Organizing your CSS

Choose a CSS organization method that appeals to you: BEM, ITCSS,
utility-first, or another one you know about. Then try to implement
it in your portfolio website.

Once you have given it a good try, take a step back and assess how well it
went. Write a paragraph or two about the ways it is working and the ways it is
not working.

::: tip
Save and commit everything before starting this, in case you get stuck and want
to undo it!

::: info
This workshop is not required because there have already been more
than the required 5 workshops. But if you want homework credit for it, you can
write up your reflection in a few paragraphs and submit it via email. Include
a link to the work-in-progress repository.
