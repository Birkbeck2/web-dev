# Workshop: Visualising Data with JavaScript

## JSON vs JavaScript objects

- Create an HTML file and a linked JavaScript file.
- Create a constant which equates to a JSON string with 5 name/value pairs naming five people and their pets.
- Use JSON.parse() to convert the JSON string into a JSON object literal.
- Create five variables and make each one equal a sentence contining one of the name/value pairs.
- Print each sentence to its own paragraph tag on the page.

- Create another constant which equates to a JavaScript object with 3 name/value pairs naming three people and their favourite fruit.
- Use JSON.stringify() to convert it into a JSON string.
- Print the resulting JSON string to another paragraph element on the page.

## Retrieving open JSON data from the web

- Create an HTML file and a linked JavaScript file.
- Use the fetch API to get emoji data from: [https://api.github.com/emojis](https://api.github.com/emojis)
- Use [https://jsonbeautify.com/](https://jsonbeautify.com/) to look at the JSON and format/beautify it.
- Pick one of the emojis which start with "smile", "smiling" or "smiley".
- Using context.drawImage() place 25 of the emojis randomly on a canvas that is 800 x 600 pixels.

## Experimenting with open JSON data

- Create an HTML file and a linked JavaScript file.
- Look at some open data sources on this page:
[https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets).
- Incorporate JSON data into a creative JavaScript program using either event handlers and the DOM, or canvas commands.
