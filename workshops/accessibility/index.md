# Workshop: Accessibility in HTML and CSS

In this workshop, you will make a short interactive web page, and then you
will do accessibility testing on someone else’s web page.

## Part 1: Make a webpage (required for homework)

1. Please create a short webpage that shows a photo, asks the user
   a question about the photo, and lets the user give a response through
   form elements.

   Make the webpage as accessible as you can.

2. In addition to being accessible, the webpage must meet these
   requirements:

    - Includes a picture. Please choose a free-to-use photo from Unsplash or
      a similar site.

    - Does not have a white background. This is just so that you have to
    think a bit about color contrasts rather than just leaving it black text
    on a white background.

    - Use at least one element for user input like `input`, `textarea`, or `select`.

    - Use at least one `button` element.

2. When you are done with the webpage, please share the GitHub repository
   with one of your fellow students (hopefully someone who was not sitting
   next to you in the workshop), and then invite them to review the pull
   request called “Feedback”.

## Part 2: Test someone else’s webpage (required for homework)

1. Please do at least two types of testing on the webpage that you have
   been invited to review.

2. Write the results of your tests as comments on the pull request on GitHub.
   With each accessibility violation, be sure to give enough info that the
   webpage author can understand how you discovered the error and reproduce it
   for themselves.

## Part 3: Create an accessible color scheme (optional)

Taking inspiration from the colors in your photograph, develop the color scheme
you used in your webpage further into a system of complementary colors that can
be used together for text, backgrounds, and accents in the webpage.

Use at least four colors (can include shades of white,
grey, or black). Define which color pairs can be used together as foreground
and background, while still meeting a contrast ratio of 4.5. Define what each
color should typically be used for and not be used for (text, icons, borders,
page backgrounds, button backgrounds/fills, etc.).
