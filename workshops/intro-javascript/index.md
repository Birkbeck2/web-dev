# Workshop: Intro JavaScript

1. Use the command line to see if you have Node.js installed, using `node
   --version`. If you don’t have it, [install it from the
   website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

2. Create a file named `intro.js` and save it in a folder where you can
   run it with the `node` command, like `node intro.js`.

3. Write some JavaScript that creates an [ASCII
   art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) checker pattern in
   your terminal. Dark squares can be represented with a `#` or `■` and
   white squares with a space or `□`.

4. Create variables with values of three different data types and log the
   type of each one to the console.

5. Create at least two number variables and log them to the console.

6. Create a string variable that contains quotation marks and log it.

7. Create a string variable that contains backslashes that show up when
   logged to the console, and log it.
